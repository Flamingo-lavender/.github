Welcome to bullshit, **redefined**.

![Core Source](https://github.com/Flamingo-lavender/shits/blob/main/Flamin%20Hott%20Flamingo%20Memes.jpeg)

### some important repositories that you may need

- [Manifest](https://github.com/Flamingo-OS/manifest)
- [Vendor](https://github.com/Flamingo-OS/vendor_flamingo)


### Note
Flamingo doesn't have pathmaps for HALs,
i.e  The paths for cloning them are also not your usual `hardware/qcom-caf/<whatever board name>`
So revert that commit [example](https://github.com/Flamingo-lavender/hardware_qcom_media/commit/9988b75c15d2b5cb830dbbabc6a7f8845b3fbcf6)


They are as HALs are as follows,
disregarding which hals your use sm8150, msm8998 or whatever

Audio -> ```vendor/qcom/opensource/audio-hal/primary-hal```

Media -> ```hardware/qcom/media```

Display -> ```hardware/qcom/display```

~~At the time of writing this I'm still using P404~~
Hehe
